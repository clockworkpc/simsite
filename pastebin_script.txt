Stage one. The minimum viable product. One server, one process, doing everything — frontend, APIs, storage.
It works... but barely. There's no redundancy, no visibility, and every user hits the same box.

We break out the frontend as an addressable layer. Clients now talk directly to the frontend.
Still monolithic, but it sets us up for something better.

Now we plug in an object store. File systems don’t scale — object storage does.
Durable, backed up, and built for high-traffic workloads.

We bring in SQL to manage metadata — paste IDs, timestamps, expiration.
The app can now answer questions, not just serve files.

Now we add a frontend load balancer. Multiple frontend instances share the load.
Traffic surges? Just spin up another node.

Object storage reads are slow. So we cache.
Hits return instantly. Misses fall back to the store. Performance, solved.

A delete endpoint lets users remove pastes.
Critical for privacy, security, and moderation.

Next, abuse guard.
Pastes are filtered before they’re stored. Think spam detection, rate limits, and content filters.

We introduce centralized logging.
Now we know what happened — and when.

From logs come metrics.
A live dashboard surfaces traffic, errors, and system health.

Clients can now query analytics through an API.
Public stats, powered by isolated infrastructure.

Analytics becomes a full microservice, backed by its own database.
Then we automate a complete ETL pipeline — extract, transform, load — to clean and feed that data.

To drop global latency, we add a CDN.
Edge caching, programmable workers, and smart rules shift load away from origin.

We manage cache rules and TTLs via a CDN config layer.
This gives us fine-grained control over what’s cached, when, and for how long.

We push logic to the edge with CDN Workers.
They can inspect requests, modify headers, even block abuse — all before traffic hits our origin.

A global DNS layer routes users to the closest region.
North America traffic goes to NA. Europe to EU.
Latency drops, and we prepare for global failover.

Our global load balancer adds redundancy across regions.
Traffic is no longer bound to one continent — we can failover, balance loads, and shift users dynamically.

We replicate our SQL database.
A load balancer routes read queries to replicas. Writes still go to the primary.
Now, read-heavy operations don’t bottleneck our write path.

Object storage and SQL access now flow through a reverse proxy.
One control point for access, throttling, and caching.

At last — the full system.
Global clients, distributed infrastructure, rate limiting, observability, ETL, analytics, CDN workers, and scalable storage.
This isn't just a pastebin. It’s a battle-tested, production-grade, global platform.

From one box to global scale... This is how systems evolve.
